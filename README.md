# makemore
Building makemore (a.k.a., generating more texts) using different language models from scratch.

Mostly inspired by the lectures from Andrej Karpathy: https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy.

There are 4 models we consider:
- Bigram: [notebook](https://github.com/uriyeobi/makemore/blob/main/bigrams.ipynb)
- Trigram: [notebook](https://github.com/uriyeobi/makemore/blob/main/trigrams.ipynb)
- MLP (Multi-layer Perceptrons): [notebook](https://github.com/uriyeobi/makemore/blob/main/mlp.ipynb)
- Transformer: [notebook](https://github.com/uriyeobi/makemore/blob/main/transformer.ipynb)

Here are sample results.
